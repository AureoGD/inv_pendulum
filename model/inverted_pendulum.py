        l (float): Length of the pendulum bar.
        br (float): Friction coefficient for the cart.
        g (float): Acceleration due to gravity.
        f_max (float): Maximum applicable force.
        v_max (float): Maximum cart velocity.
        x_max (float): Maximum cart position from the center.

        a (float): Current angle of the pendulum in radians.
        da (float): Current angular velocity of the pendulum.
